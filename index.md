## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
My design intent is to create a cosplay sword prop that incoporates the microbit. I plan to add lights and sounds.

### Design concept 1 ###
Initially I wanted to create my sword prop from wood using the laser cutter and workshop, however due to the Covid-19 pandemic this is no longer possible for me. I tried reaching out to some friends of friends that I knew did woodworking but I couldn't find anybody willing to let me use their workshop.

### Design concept 2 ###
My second idea was to create the sword mostly out of foam. While this would likely be the cheapest and easiest method I feel it wouldn't turn out the best and would be very delicate.

### Final design concept ###
My final decision was to use plastic for most of the sword design. For the hilt I plan to use PVC piping. This works well as I plan to store my battery packs inside the hilt, and the PVC pipes are already hollow. For the handguard and blade I intend to use acrylic either painted or covered in foam. I will house my microbit inside the hollow handguard and my LED Strip will run up the back of the blade. I will cover the blade and cut out a lightning design along the sides, so when the LED strip is turned on the light will pass through the acrylic and shine out of the lightning.

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

I laid out how I will create each piece of my prop and fit them together using Adobe Illustrator, and made sure to include measurements.

My current circuit layout to be improved upon.

I have figured out how to turn on my LED strip, I plan to make it more complex in the future, possibly with different movements adjusting how they light up.

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
