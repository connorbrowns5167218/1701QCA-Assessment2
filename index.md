How to make a Wooden Katana from hardwood flooring // Woodworking

I intially intended to use this video as a guide to creating my prop sword, however without access to woodworking equipment I was unable to use wood as my material.

This video is partially what inspired me to make a glowing sword prop using acrylic for the blade. My version will be much larger and complex.

The PVC Katana Build-Along

This project shows how to make a sword using PVC piping. I plan to only use PVC on my hilt and possibly handguard.

This project uses EVA Foam to create a katana sword prop. This is my backup plan if Acrylic proves too difficult to use.

This project uses wood and electricity to create a super cool lightning design on a sword, and then the design is filled with a glow in the dark powder.

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###

My design intent is to create a cosplay sword prop that incoporates the microbit. I plan to add lights and sounds.

### Design concept 1 ###

Initially I wanted to create my sword prop from wood using the laser cutter and workshop, however due to the Covid-19 pandemic this is no longer possible for me. I tried reaching out to some friends of friends that I knew did woodworking but I couldn't find anybody willing to let me use their workshop.

### Design concept 2 ###

My second idea was to create the sword mostly out of foam. While this would likely be the cheapest and easiest method I feel it wouldn't turn out the best and would be very delicate.

### Final design concept ###

My final decision was to use plastic for most of the sword design. For the hilt I plan to use PVC piping. This works well as I plan to store my battery packs inside the hilt, and the PVC pipes are already hollow. For the handguard and blade I intend to use acrylic either painted or covered in foam. I will house my microbit inside the hollow handguard and my LED Strip will run up the back of the blade. I will cover the blade and cut out a lightning design along the sides, so when the LED strip is turned on the light will pass through the acrylic and shine out of the lightning.

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

I laid out how I will create each piece of my prop and fit them together using Adobe Illustrator, and made sure to include measurements.

My current circuit layout to be improved upon.

I have figured out how to turn on my LED strip, I plan to make it more complex in the future, possibly with different movements adjusting how they light up.

## Design process discussion ##

So far I have planned out my sword and started on my microbit circuit.

## Next steps ##

Soon I will begin working on my sword and finish my microbit circuit. After both of those are complete I will put the circuit into the sword and it will be ready to submit.
