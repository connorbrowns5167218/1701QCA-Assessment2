### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
My design intent is to create a cosplay sword prop that incoporates the microbit. I plan to add lights and sounds.

### Design concept 1 ###
Made from Wood

### Design concept 2 ###
Made from Foam

### Final design concept ###
Made from Plastic

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*
